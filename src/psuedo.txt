Scenario 1:

-An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly
until the user enters a zero value. Then determine the sum of all the negatives and positive values.


Scenario 2ario
-An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
returns their arithmetic average.

Scenario 3
-An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
 (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

 scenario 4
 request user to x,y
 calculate s=x+y
 calculate A=s/2
 calculate p=x*y
 write s,a,p
